\title{Perform a Student's T-test comparing a metric to each column of a matrix}
\usage{
vectorized_t_test(m, y, var.equal = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided")
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{binary matrix}

\item{y}{numeric vector to test each column of m against}

\item{var.equal}{assume that the variances are equal}

\item{alternative}{whether to use a one-sided test, and if so which way}
}
\description{
This function is similar to \code{apply(m, 2, function(col) t.test(y ~ col)$p.value)},
but is vectorized to make it much faster
